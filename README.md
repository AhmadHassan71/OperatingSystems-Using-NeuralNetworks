# OperatingSystems-Using-NeuralNetworks
## Problem Statement
You have to design an operating system that implements a neural network architecture using separate
processes and threads on a multi-core processor. The system should use inter-process communication
through pipes for exchanging information such as weights and biases between processes. Each layer of
the neural network should be represented as a separate process, and each neuron within a layer should
be treated as a separate thread. During backpropagation, the error signal should be propagated backward
through the layers of the network, and the system should update the weights and biases based on the
calculated gradients, while utilizing the processing power of multiple cores.
